## 🧭 Overview

**SpatialCL** is a *plug-and-play contrastive learning framework* designed for spatially structured modalities, including **RGB**, **thermal**, **RGB-D** data etc.
It robustly handles *intra-* and *inter-class variability*, enabling consistent embeddings across challenging datasets.

🧪 As a demonstration of its capabilities, **SpatialCL** has been applied in **[DiSCO 🔗](https://github.com/Olemou/SpatialCL)** — *Detection of Spills in Indoor environments using weakly supervised contrastive learning* — showcasing its practical impact in real-world spill detection scenarios.

⚙️ While the framework is **modality-agnostic** and can be extended to other dense spatial tasks, extending **SpatialCL** to sparse, graph-structured data such as **skeletons** represents an exciting direction for future work.

**figure 1:** *Through the encoder, feature embeddings are extracted to obtain zij , which are subsequently normalized*. *From these embeddings, the cohesion*
*score cij is computed, representing how likely samples xi and xj remain compact within the same* *co-cluster. A binomial opinion is modeled as a Beta*
*probability density function (PDF), under the assumption of a bijective mapping between both representations. The uncertainty uij is then computed to*
*measure the confidence that xi and xj can be close within a cluster, enabling the model to avoid forcing samples of the same class together despite strong*
*visual differences. To ensure stable and gradual learning, a curriculum function  is introduced to guide progressive training and to*
*compute the adaptive weight wij , addressing intra-class variability. For inter-class modeling, the parameter β is computed as described in the schema above*,
*allowing the model to focus on hard negatives and enhance class separation. All these components are integrated into the final loss function Lij .*
