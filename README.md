# UCL-VAR
We propose UCL-VAR (Uncertainty-aware Contrastive Learning for Variability-Aware Representation), a framework addressing intra-class and inter-class variability in RGB and thermal modalities. DISCO (Detection of Indoor Spills via Contrastive Learning) serves as a key component for robust spill detection in safety-critical environments.
